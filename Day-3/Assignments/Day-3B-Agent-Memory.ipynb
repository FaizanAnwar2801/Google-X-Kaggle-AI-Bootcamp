    "| **Cross-Conversation Recall** | Access information from any past conversation | \"What preferences has this user mentioned across all chats?\" |\n",
    "| **Intelligent Extraction** | LLM-powered consolidation extracts key facts | Stores \"allergic to peanuts\" instead of 50 raw messages |\n",

    "**Callbacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK's callback system lets you hook into key execution moments. Callbacks are **Python functions** you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle.** When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available callback types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `before_agent_callback` → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n",
    "- `after_agent_callback` → Runs after agent completes its turn  \n",
    "- `before_tool_callback` / `after_tool_callback` → Around tool invocations\n",
    "- `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` → Around LLM calls\n",
    "- `on_model_error_callback` → When errors occur\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging and observability (track what the agent does)\n",
    "- Automatic data persistence (like saving to memory)\n",
    "- Custom validation or filtering\n",
    "- Performance monitoring\n",

    "But here's the challenge: how does our callback function actually access the memory service and current session? That's where `callback_context` comes in.\n",
