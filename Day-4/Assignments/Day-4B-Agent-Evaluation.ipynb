    "* **Response Match Score:** Measures how similar the agent's actual response is to the expected response. Uses text similarity algorithms to compare content. A score of 1.0 = perfect match, 0.0 = completely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tool Trajectory Score:** Measures whether the agent used the correct tools with correct parameters. Checks the sequence of tool calls against expected behavior. A score of 1.0 = perfect tool usage, 0.0 = wrong tools or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do: Analyze a Failure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's intentionally break the test to see what a failure looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the list of eval cases, click the Edit (pencil) icon next to your test case.\n",
    "2. In the \"Final Response\" text box, change the expected text to something incorrect, like: `The desk lamp is off`.\n",
    "3. Save the changes and re-run the evaluation.\n",
    "4. This time, the result will be a red Fail. Hover your mouse over the \"Fail\" label. A tooltip will appear showing a side-by-side comparison of the Actual vs. Expected Output, highlighting exactly why the test failed (the final response didn't match).\n",
    "This immediate, detailed feedback is invaluable for debugging."

    "### Section 5: User Simulation (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "While **traditional evaluation methods rely on fixed test cases**, real-world conversations are dynamic and unpredictable. This is where User Simulation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Simulation is a powerful feature in ADK that addresses the limitations of static evaluation. Instead of using pre-defined, fixed user prompts, User Simulation employs a generative AI model (like Gemini) to **dynamically generate user prompts during the evaluation process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "* You define a `ConversationScenario` that outlines the user's overall conversational goals and a `conversation_plan` to guide the dialogue.\n",
    "* A large language model (LLM) then acts as a simulated user, using this plan and the ongoing conversation history to generate realistic and varied prompts.\n",
    "* This allows for more comprehensive testing of your agent's ability to handle unexpected turns, maintain context, and achieve complex goals in a more natural, unpredictable conversational flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Simulation helps you uncover edge cases and improve your agent's robustness in ways that static test cases often miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the power of User Simulation for dynamic agent evaluation, here's an exercise to apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the **User Simulation** feature to your agent. Define a `ConversationScenario` with a `conversation_plan` for a specific goal, and integrate it into your agent's evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refer to this [documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/user-sim/) to learn how to do it.**"
